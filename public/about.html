            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I was on an e-sports team in high school, as I have been playing video games ever since I could remember as a child. It's one of my passions and something I do almost daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Computers:</strong> I got my first computer when I was 8 years old. Having been exposed to computers at such a young age, I developed a sense of understanding that most people lack.I have experience in Windows and Linux. I built a Linux server myself, which I use to run multiple game servers. I plan to use the server to host websites as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Music:</strong> I have always enjoyed lisenting to music while doing other stuff at the same time such as my other hobbies. My current favourite genre is rock. I enjoy the music so much I am trying to learn guiter along with my other hobbies.</li>

        <div class="section" id="Skills">
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech savy:</strong> Since I have been around technology at a very young age I have alot of experience with multiple different types of technology, from helping my Grandmother with her Android device to working on Linux servers as a hobbie. I have also built numberous computers which as contributed to my troubleshooting skills. When any of my friends have problems with computers they usally ask me, I am known as the computer guy.</li>
                <li><strong>Time management:</strong> I have a complete schedule of what I do in a day to not overspend time on a certain subject. This broadens the amount of topics I can cover in a day with all the different subjects I have to focus on a day. As my proirities change, so does my schedule since my top priority is university I that is top of my to-do list.</li>
                <li><strong>Life-time learner:</strong> Life-time learner: I stay up-to-date with all my hobbies and interests by subscribing to multiple tech and coding channels on YouTube. I keep myself informed about the latest news and developments in the modern world. Before forming an opinion on any topic, I always conduct thorough research and seek out multiple perspectives. This approach helps me see the complete picture and navigate the internet, which is often filled with misinformation.
